				<h1>WHY YOU SHOULD START USING SYNTHOL RIGHT NOW</h1>

						<div class="article__text">The scene was the 1999 NPC California Championships in Redondo Beach, prejudging. Shouts of encouragement, "stay tight!" and "legs!" rang our from the darkness up to the stage, bathed in almost blinding bright light as glistening light-heavyweights kept entire bodies tense under the scrutiny of the judges. In a lineup of nearly thirty top-notch Golden State physiques, one man stood out from the rest, garnering the majority of the spectators' attention as they pointed and whispered about him. It wasn't because he was in contention for first place. In fact, he was unofficially disqualified the moment he strode out from the theater's wings.</div>
						<div class="article__text">This sorry bastard, in hopes of becoming Mr. California like Flex Wheeler, Chris Cormier, Dennis Newman and many others before who went on to stardom, had injected what appeared to be gallons of the infamous Synthol into his delts, arms, calves, and traps. Oddly shaped but gigantic arms that would rival any pro led down to spindly forearms that were no bigger than the average guy in the gym. Delts that looked like they were stolen from Paul Dillett tied into average-sized lats and pecs. The oil-inflated muscle groups were so shiny and round that they would look out of place on any human body. "Skeeter bites!" the guy sitting next to me shouted. "Looks like he got attacked by some giant mosquitos!" he brayed. Laughs and jeers echoed in the air at his ridiculous appearance. He had hoped his ruse would be successful, but he ended up being nothing more than a silly joke, comic relief at a serious athletic competition.</div>

						<div class="article__img_caption">The right exaple how you sould NOT do. Please don’t.</div>
						<div class="article__text article__text_margin">Scenarios like the one above are becoming more common every month. Our unfortunate would-be Mr. California is much like many thousands of frustrated lifters out there who refuse to settle for what their genetics limited them to in terms of muscular development.</div>
						<h2 class="article__title article__title_little">THE TITEL OF THE SECOND LEVEL</h2>
						<div class="article__text article__text_none">Of course, steroid use in and of itself is the most widespread expression of this dissatisfaction and rebellion. For decades now, men and women all around the globe have taken pills and injections that allowed them to far surpass the degrees of size and strength they would have been capable of naturally. We have witnessed entire generations of bodybuilders swell up to mammoth proportions thanks to steroids. Just ten years ago, anyone over 220 pounds was considered a giant. Now, to earn the same classification, one must tip the scales closer to 300 pounds!</div>
